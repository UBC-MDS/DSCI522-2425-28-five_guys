## Test suite developer notes

### Running the tests
Tests are run using the `pytest` command in the root of the project.

Note: We are currently using the complete dataset in our script, which is why it may take around one minute to complete all our tests. In the next update, we will add a toy dataset that will initialize the preprocessor and run the full analysis of the sample dataset.
