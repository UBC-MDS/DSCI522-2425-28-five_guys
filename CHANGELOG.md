## Feedback Sources and Fixes

### Milestone 1 Feedback

Feedback from Milestome 1 were:
- Reorganize the project folder structure, specifically analysis notebook (.ipynb or .Qmd or *Rmd) should be in a sub-directory called something sensible, such as analysis, src, notebooks, docs, etc
- The email under "enforcement" in the CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md should be tied to the team
- Include the environment.yml file along side the existing conda environment files
- Fix issues related to figure display
- Many branch names are not meaningful (they should reflect the work being done on the branch)

All these feedback were raised in this [issue](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/DSCI522-2425-28-rental-bike-prediction/issues/47) and corrected with these set of PRs: [PR1](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/DSCI522-2425-28-rental-bike-prediction/pull/50), [PR2](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/DSCI522-2425-28-rental-bike-prediction/pull/36), [PR3](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/DSCI522-2425-28-rental-bike-prediction/pull/75), 


### Milestone 2 Feedback

Feedback from Milestome 2 was:
- Fix Docker image tag because tag pulled from image is pinned to latest and this would potentially cause a similar issue as pinning it to latest in the main Dockerfile

This feedback was raised in this [issue](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/DSCI522-2425-28-rental-bike-prediction/issues/86) and was fixed with this [PR](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/DSCI522-2425-28-rental-bike-prediction/pull/87)
