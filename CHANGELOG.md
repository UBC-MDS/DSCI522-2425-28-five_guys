## Feedback Sources and Fixes

### Milestone 1 Feedback

Feedback from Milestome 1 were:
- Reorganize the project folder structure, specifically analysis notebook (.ipynb or .Qmd or *Rmd) should be in a sub-directory called something sensible, such as analysis, src, notebooks, docs, etc
- The email under "enforcement" in the CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md should be tied to the team
- Include the environment.yml file along side the existing conda environment files
- Fix issues related to figure display
- Many branch names are not meaningful (they should reflect the work being done on the branch)

All these feedback were raised in this [issue](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/DSCI522-2425-28-rental-bike-prediction/issues/47) and corrected with these set of PRs: [PR1](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/DSCI522-2425-28-rental-bike-prediction/pull/50), [PR2](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/DSCI522-2425-28-rental-bike-prediction/pull/36), [PR3](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/DSCI522-2425-28-rental-bike-prediction/pull/75), 


### Milestone 2 Feedback

Feedback from Milestome 2 was:
- Fix Docker image tag because tag pulled from image is pinned to latest and this would potentially cause a similar issue as pinning it to latest in the main Dockerfile

This feedback was raised in this [issue](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/DSCI522-2425-28-rental-bike-prediction/issues/86) and was fixed with this [PR](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/DSCI522-2425-28-rental-bike-prediction/pull/87)


### [Peer Review Feedback](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/data-analysis-review-2024/issues/7)

In summary, the peer review feedbacks are as followed:
- Add cross-referencing hyperlinks for figures and tables 
- Add brief description of each figure and table to explain their relevance
- Reduce number of plots by focusing on the most relevant ones and summarizing less critical ones
- Correct grammatical errors for a consistent and professional tone
- Correct incorrect comments in scripts
- Rename LICENSE file to LICENSE.md for better readability (After consulting with the instructor, it was determined that this comment was irrelevant and therefore not addressed)
